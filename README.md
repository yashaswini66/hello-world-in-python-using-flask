### Run a Simple "Hello, World!" App using Flask

Here is a detailed description of the "Hello, World!" application using Flask:

Importing the Flask Class

from flask import Flask


This line imports the Flask class from the flask module. The Flask class is the core of the Flask web framework.

Creating a New Flask Application

app = Flask(__name__)


This line creates a new instance of the Flask class, passing the current module name (__name__) as the argument. This creates a new Flask application.

Defining a Route

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello, World!"


This block defines a new route for the Flask application. The @app.route("/") decorator specifies that this function should be called when the root URL ("/") is accessed.

The hello_world() function returns the string "Hello, World!" when this route is accessed.

Running the Application

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


This block checks if the script is being run directly (i.e., not being imported as a module by another script). If so, it runs the Flask application using the app.run() method.

How it Works
1. When the script is run, the Flask application is created and the route is defined.
2. When a user accesses the root URL ("/") in their web browser, the hello_world() function is called.
3. The hello_world() function returns the string "Hello, World!", which is sent back to the user's web browser.
4. The user sees the "Hello, World!" message in their web browser.
